This Node.js command-line application allows users to easily generate logos for their companies. You can start the application by running:

```
node index.js
```

The program uses the `inquirer` npm package to prompt the user for a background shape and color, 1-3 characters, and a color for the characters. The logo is then generated in the `generated-svgs` folder. It also uses `jest` to test the shape classes.
